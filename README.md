# Graphing calculator and function plotter
Making a plot can be difficult, especially if you need to graph many functions together. That is why we have created this special online application, which allows you not only to plot several graphs, but also save the result as an image in PNG format. It is absolutely free and does not require any registration. It is also available for use directly in your browser without any additional manipulations.
